## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

1. **Dependencies**
   - Keep all dependencies up to date
   - Regularly run `pip install --upgrade` for Python packages
   - Review Docker base images for security updates
   - Monitor security advisories for dependencies
   - Use fixed versions in requirements.txt

2. **Environment Variables**
   - Never commit `.env` files
   - Use `.env.example` as a template
   - Keep sensitive credentials out of the codebase
   - Rotate secrets regularly
   - Use strong, unique values for each environment

3. **Code Security**
   - Follow OWASP security guidelines
   - Implement proper input validation
   - Use prepared statements for database queries
   - Enable CORS appropriately
   - Keep debug mode disabled in production
   - Log security-relevant events
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Use secure random number generation
   - Validate file uploads
   - Sanitize user input

### For Users

1. **Authentication**
   - Use strong passwords (minimum 12 characters)
   - Enable two-factor authentication when available
   - Keep access tokens secure
   - Don't share credentials
   - Log out from shared devices

2. **API Usage**
   - Protect your API keys
   - Use HTTPS for all requests
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Monitor API usage
   - Rotate keys periodically

3. **Environment Setup**
   - Use production settings in deployment
   - Enable all security headers
   - Configure proper firewall rules
   - Regular security audits
   - Monitor system logs
