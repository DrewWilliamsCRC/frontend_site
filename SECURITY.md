## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

1. **Dependencies**
   - Keep all dependencies up to date
   - Regularly run `pip install --upgrade` for Python packages
   - Review Docker base images for security updates

2. **Environment Variables**
   - Never commit `.env` files
   - Use `.env.example` as a template
   - Keep sensitive credentials out of the codebase

3. **Code Security**
   - Follow OWASP security guidelines
   - Implement proper input validation
   - Use prepared statements for database queries
   - Enable CORS appropriately
   - Keep debug mode disabled in production

### For Users
